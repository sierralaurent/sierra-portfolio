        <h1 className={'text-3xl'}>Overview</h1>
        <p>A fictional craft beer brewery imagined by myself is based out of Vancouver, BC, Hops & Pigs 
            decided to stand out in the never-ending craft beer aisle and put something different on the 
            front of their cans, BUGS. It is often seen as a design never-do, but Hops & Pigâ€™s wanted to try it, 
            as they knew their customers loved trying every different beer they could put out. They wanted to stay 
            true to their colours of pink and white but were open to venturing out to more colours.</p>
        <h1 className={'text-3xl'}>Ideation</h1>
        <p>Once I saw this Pantone swatch pop up on my Pinterest feed, I knew I must bring this into a design and give it life, even better 
            it was given an awesome name, beetle wing. Bringing the colour to its name, I imagined it with a beautiful black horn beetle, vectorized 
            and simplified to make it less scary, it belonged on the front of one of the best beers to exist, a hazy IPA.</p>
